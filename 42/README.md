42 is a comprehensive general-purpose simulation of spacecraft attitude and orbit dynamics. Its primary purpose is to support design and validation of attitude control systems, from concept studies through integration and test. 42 accurately models multi-body spacecraft attitude dynamics (with rigid and/or flexible bodies), and both two-body and three-body orbital flight regimes, modelling environments from low Earth orbit to throughout the solar system. 42 simulates multiple spacecraft concurrently, facilitating studies of rendezvous, proximity operations, and precision formation flying. It also features visualization of spacecraft attitude.
